# CSS Basics

## Embedded Stylesheets
CSS styles can be embedded in an HTML document using `<style>` tags.

## External Stylesheets
External stylesheets are separate CSS files linked to HTML using `<link>` tags. They promote maintainability by separating content and presentation.

## Hexadecimal Colors
Colors can be specified using hexadecimal values (`#RRGGBB`).

## HSL Colors
HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) colors offer an alternative way to specify colors.

## Inheritance
Some CSS properties inherit values from their parent elements, promoting consistency in styling.

## Inline Styles
Styles can be applied directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute, which takes precedence over embedded and external stylesheets.

## Linear Gradients
Linear gradients can be created using the `linear-gradient()` function in CSS for smooth color transitions.

## Normalizing CSS
CSS normalization (like Normalize.css) ensures consistent rendering across browsers by resetting default styles.

## Pseudo-Class Selectors
Pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`, `:first-child`) style elements based on their state or position.

## Pseudo-Element Selectors
Pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before`, `::after`) style specific parts of elements.

## Radial Gradients
Radial gradients (`radial-gradient()`) create color transitions from a central point outward.

## Relational Selectors
Selectors like adjacent sibling (`+`), general sibling (`~`), and child (`>`) allow targeting elements based on their relationship to other elements.

## RGB Colors
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values specify colors in terms of their component intensities.

## Selectors Specificity
CSS selectors have varying specificity, influencing which styles apply when multiple rules target the same element.

## Separation of Concerns
Separating HTML (content) and CSS (presentation) enhances code maintainability and scalability.
